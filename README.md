# MOODTUNES

## Description
MoodTunes is a web-based music application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The goal is to help users find the right music during moments of stress or overstimulated.

The app uses emotion detection and limited choices to automatically generate a Spotify playlist that fits the user’s mood.     
Users can play the playlist directly or save it to their own Spotify account.

This project was made for Project 4 as a working prototype.  
All music data comes from the real Spotify Web API using OAuth authorization.
